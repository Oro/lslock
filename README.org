* lslock
=lslock= comes with two executables, =lslock= and =lslock-test=.
=lslock= checks a given directory (and subdirectories) for any locked files and outputs them.
=lslock-test= locks a given number of files in a given directory and is used to check the validity of =lslock=.
See =lslock --help= or =lslock-test --help= for parameters.
